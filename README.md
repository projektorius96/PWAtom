# Project name: PWAtom

> ### **DISCLAIMER.** Tested only on x64 Windows 11 (and onwards) machine

---

### **Motivation**

> This is a "minimum" (hence "**Atom**" for **PWAtom**) vendor-standardised configurable UI prototype of **PWA** I personally would like to see in the future...

### **To initiate the process**

1.  Prerequisites: `npm ci`
2.  Run command: `npx electron index.mjs`
3.  Mouseover the `<nav>` (_the very top element in light-grey color at the level of **toolbar controls**_) and start dragging the application window, whilst dragging observe changes; toolbar controls are ready to use as well!
